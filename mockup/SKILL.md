  Use when building a terminal/ANSI mockup for a design discussion, before
  locking in a visual or rendering change. Triggers include "mock this up",
  "show me a mockup", "render this as ANSI", "let's compare a couple of
  layouts". Do NOT use for the separate live-binary-preview workflow
  (launching the real compiled binary, see the `live-preview` skill), since
  that already runs real code and has no quality-consistency problem to fix.

# Terminal mockup

Standardizes how fake (not-real-binary) ANSI terminal mockups get built for
design discussions, so they no longer vary in quality by construction
method, window naming, or dimension accuracy.

## 0. Determine this app's mockup shape

Two shapes exist across these TUI apps, and they use different dimensions:

- **Fixed-width popup card** (e.g. rolomux, boomerang): the real binary
  launches into a tmux popup of a known fixed width. Mockups are an 84-col
  card with a 2-cell blank margin (80-col drawn content).
- **Fills the terminal** (e.g. backlog): the real binary has no fixed
  width, it fills whatever terminal/pane it's given. Mockups use a
  representative size, 100 columns x 30 rows, instead of a popup card.

Determine which shape this app uses before mocking anything up: check how
the real binary is launched (the `live-preview` skill's `mux spawn`
invocation, the app's README "Usage" section, or how `main.rs` sizes its
viewport). If genuinely ambiguous, ask rather than assume. Once known, reuse
that shape's dimensions for every mockup in this repo — don't re-derive it
per task.

## 1. Start: task ID and topic

Generate one short ID at the start of the mockup task, reused for every
window/pane spawned during it:

```bash
id=$(date +%H%M%S)
```

Pick a topic: the GitHub issue number if this work is tied to one (e.g.
`70`), else a short kebab-case description (e.g. `settings-rename`). Window
titles are always `<topic>-mockup-<id>` (never spaces, ever).

## 2. Pick a construction method

**Default: Python.** Use for the common case: text/layout mockups that
don't need to prove an exact color match or a genuinely complex multi-panel
widget layout.

**Escalate to ratatui** only when: the mockup needs to verify an exact color
against the app's real palette, or the layout is complex enough that a
hand-approximated widget risks misleading the design discussion. Ratatui
mockups cost meaningfully more (boilerplate widget/layout code, a
`cargo build`/`run` cycle, real risk of a compile-error round-trip), so
don't reach for it by default.

## 3. Default construction: Python (stdlib only)

Write the mockup script to the Claude Code scratchpad directory (never into
the repo). Every mockup uses this helper; never hand-pad a row:

```python
import re

ANSI_FG = {
    'Black': 30, 'Red': 31, 'Green': 32, 'Yellow': 33,
    'Blue': 34, 'Magenta': 35, 'Cyan': 36, 'Gray': 37,
    'DarkGray': 90, 'LightRed': 91, 'LightGreen': 92, 'LightYellow': 93,
    'LightBlue': 94, 'LightMagenta': 95, 'LightCyan': 96, 'White': 97,
}
ANSI_BG = {name: code + 10 for name, code in ANSI_FG.items()}
RESET = "\x1b[0m"

def fg(name: str) -> str:
    return f"\x1b[{ANSI_FG[name]}m"

def bg(name: str) -> str:
    return f"\x1b[{ANSI_BG[name]}m"

ANSI_RE = re.compile(r'\x1b\[[0-9;]*m')

def visible_width(s: str) -> int:
    return len(ANSI_RE.sub('', s))

def row(content: str, width: int, left='', right='') -> str:
    pad = width - visible_width(content) - visible_width(left) - visible_width(right)
    return f"{left}{content}{' ' * max(pad, 0)}{right}"
```

`visible_width` always measures the ANSI-stripped string, so padding (and
any border characters) land in the same column on every row regardless of
how many color codes are embedded earlier in that row. `wcwidth` is
unnecessary as long as the project's UI is plain ASCII box-drawing with no
wide characters.

Fixed-width popup example (an 84-col card with a 2-cell margin, one colored
header row, bordered with `left='│', right='│'`):

```python
WIDTH = 84
MARGIN = 2
CARD_WIDTH = WIDTH - MARGIN * 2  # 80

def main():
    blank_margin = " " * WIDTH
    print(blank_margin)
    print(" " * MARGIN + "┌" + "─" * (CARD_WIDTH - 2) + "┐" + " " * MARGIN)
    title = f"{fg('Cyan')} PINNED{RESET}"
    print(" " * MARGIN + row(title, CARD_WIDTH, '│', '│') + " " * MARGIN)
    print(" " * MARGIN + row("  1  my-session", CARD_WIDTH, '│', '│') + " " * MARGIN)
    print(" " * MARGIN + "└" + "─" * (CARD_WIDTH - 2) + "┘" + " " * MARGIN)
    print(blank_margin)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Fills-terminal example (a 100-col search results list, one row highlighted,
no card border):

```python
WIDTH = 100

def main():
    print(row(f"{fg('White')} search: hollow knight{RESET}", WIDTH))
    print(row("", WIDTH))
    rows = [
        ("Hollow Knight", "steam", True),
        ("Hollow Knight: Silksong", "steam", False),
        ("Knight Squad", "epic", False),
    ]
    for name, platform, selected in rows:
        line = f" {fg('Cyan')}{name}{RESET}  {fg('Blue')}{platform}{RESET}"
        line_bg = bg('DarkGray') if selected else ''
        print(f"{line_bg}{row(line, WIDTH)}{RESET}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## 4. Escalation: ratatui-rendered mockups

Write a throwaway `examples/mockup.rs` in the project repo, always this
exact filename (one standing `.gitignore` entry, never a new name per
mockup). It builds the screen from real `ratatui` widgets using
`CrosstermBackend<Vec<u8>>`, which captures the actual SGR/cursor bytes
crossterm would emit to a real terminal: the same rendering path the
shipped binary uses, so alignment and color output are correct by
construction, not by care.

Use `Viewport::Fixed` explicitly, sized to whichever shape this app uses (84
x whatever height for a fixed-width popup, 100x30 for fills-terminal).
Without it, `CrosstermBackend::size()` queries the real attached terminal's
size via `crossterm::terminal::size()`, which is wrong (or outright errors,
since the agent's Bash tool has no controlling tty) when rendering
headlessly. A fixed viewport sidesteps this entirely.

`CrosstermBackend::writer()` is gated behind an unstable ratatui feature and
isn't callable on the pinned version, so don't rely on it to get the bytes
back out. Instead wrap the `Vec<u8>` in `Rc<RefCell<...>>` and keep your own
handle to it:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::io::{self, Write};
use std::rc::Rc;

use ratatui::{
    backend::CrosstermBackend,
    layout::Rect,
    style::{Color, Style},
    text::{Line, Span},
    widgets::{Block, Borders, Paragraph},
    Terminal, TerminalOptions, Viewport,
};

const WIDTH: u16 = 84;   // or 100 for a fills-terminal app
const HEIGHT: u16 = 20;  // or 30 for a fills-terminal app
const MARGIN: u16 = 2;   // 0 for a fills-terminal app (no popup card)

#[derive(Clone)]
struct SharedBuf(Rc<RefCell<Vec<u8>>>);

impl Write for SharedBuf {
    fn write(&mut self, buf: &[u8]) -> io::Result<usize> {
        self.0.borrow_mut().write(buf)
    }
    fn flush(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let buf = Rc::new(RefCell::new(Vec::<u8>::new()));
    let backend = CrosstermBackend::new(SharedBuf(buf.clone()));
    let viewport = Viewport::Fixed(Rect::new(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT));
    let mut terminal = Terminal::with_options(backend, TerminalOptions { viewport })?;
    terminal.draw(|frame| {
        let area = Rect::new(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
        let inner = Rect::new(
            area.x + MARGIN,
            area.y + MARGIN,
            area.width.saturating_sub(MARGIN * 2),
            area.height.saturating_sub(MARGIN * 2),
        );
        let block = Block::default().borders(Borders::ALL);
        let title = Paragraph::new(Line::from(Span::styled(
            " PINNED",
            Style::default().fg(Color::Cyan),
        )))
        .block(block);
        frame.render_widget(title, inner);
    })?;
    let bytes = buf.borrow();
    print!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&bytes));
    Ok(())
}
```

Run via `cargo run --example mockup --quiet`. If the crate has a lib target,
the example can `use <crate>::...` directly to reuse real functions (color
constants, etc.) rather than hand-copying them. Bin-only crates use
`ratatui::style::Color`'s named variants directly instead.

Note: crossterm serializes ratatui's named colors as `\x1b[38;5;0` through
`\x1b[38;5;15` (an indexed SGR form), not the classic `\x1b[30`-`\x1b[37`/
`\x1b[90`-`\x1b[97` form the Python path uses. That's still the terminal's
themed 16-color palette, not true 256-color or RGB; indices 0-15 are
exactly the same 16 named colors, just addressed differently. Don't mistake
a `38;5;N`/`48;5;N` (N <= 15) match for a color-fidelity violation when
checking ratatui-path output.

## 5. Standards (both methods)

- **Size**: whichever shape section 0 determined for this app. Fixed-width
  popup: always 84 columns, 2-cell margin, 80-col drawn card; height has no
  fixed number, pick whatever's reasonable for the content. Fills-terminal:
  a representative **100 columns x 30 rows**, unless the discussion
  specifically concerns behavior at a narrower/shorter size, in which case
  mock up that size instead and say so.
- **Colors**: only the 16 named ANSI colors shown in the `ANSI_FG`/`ANSI_BG`
  tables above (matches `ratatui::style::Color`'s named, non-RGB variants);
  never invent a color the real app couldn't produce.

## 6. Launching

```bash
tab=$(mux spawn --workspace caller --title "${topic}-mockup-${id}" --json | jq -r .tab)
```

Always prefix the actual render command with `clear &&` when sending it to
the pane: not needed for the Python path (sequential `print()` never uses
absolute cursor positioning), but required for the ratatui path, since
`CrosstermBackend`'s diffing renderer emits absolute `MoveTo(x,y)` codes
that would otherwise land on top of whatever the pane's shell prompt already
printed:

```bash
mux send --tab "$tab" --cmd "clear && python3 /path/to/scratch_mockup.py"
# or, for the ratatui path:
mux send --tab "$tab" --cmd "clear && cargo run --example mockup --quiet"
```

**Comparing 2+ options**: spawn one window, then add a real tmux pane per
extra option (never a separate window, never a virtualized text trick):

```bash
tmux split-window -h -t "$tab"   # left-right, if the window is wide enough
tmux split-window -t "$tab"      # stacked top-bottom otherwise (tmux default)
```

For a fixed-width popup app, check whether the window is wide enough for a
true left-right split first (`N` options need `N*84 + (N-1)` columns):

```bash
width=$(tmux display-message -p -t "$tab" '#{window_width}')
```

Write one script per option and label each variant inline in its own title
row (e.g. `<app> -- BEFORE arrow` / `<app> -- AFTER arrow`, using this
repo's actual app name) so the two panes are distinguishable at a glance
without relying on pane position or memory of which command went where.

`mux send --tab` only reaches a tab's *active* pane, so once split, target
each pane directly. Grab their IDs first, then send each variant's command
to its own pane:

```bash
tmux list-panes -t "$tab" -F '#{pane_id}'
tmux send-keys -t "%142" "clear && python3 /path/to/variant_a.py" Enter
tmux send-keys -t "%143" "clear && python3 /path/to/variant_b.py" Enter
```

## 7. Cleanup (mandatory, every time)

Once you've reacted to the mockup (approved it, asked for changes, or
moved on), tear down unconditionally, not just on approval:

```bash
mux close --tab "$tab"
rm -f /path/to/scratch_mockup.py
rm -f examples/mockup.rs   # only if the ratatui path was used
```

Deleting `examples/mockup.rs` isn't just tidiness: it sits under `cargo
clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` (or similar), part of your own local
build/test loop. Leaving it around would break the *next*, unrelated `cargo
clippy` run.
