  Use whenever the task is to record, re-record, or update a GIF or video
  demo of a tmux-based tool — a tmux popup, plugin, or any TUI driven from

  `.tape` file needs to run `tmux` commands to set up or drive a recording,
  even outside of vhs specifically, because the isolation rules here are
  what stop a scripted tmux command from accidentally hitting the real,
  currently-attached tmux server instead of a throwaway one. Trigger this
  before writing a `.tape` file, before running `tmux new-session` /
  `tmux -L` / `tmux kill-server` as part of any recording or screenshot
  task, and before regenerating an existing demo asset (e.g. "update the
  README gif", "the popup UI changed, can you re-record the demo",
  "record a quick screencast of prefix+X"). Running tmux automation without
  following this skill has previously torn down a real, in-use tmux server
  and every session inside it — treat that as a live risk, not a
  hypothetical.

# Recording tmux tools with vhs

Records of tmux popups and other tmux-driven TUIs are trickier than a
normal terminal recording: the thing you're demoing is chrome that only
exists *inside a running tmux server* (`display-popup`, a status line, a
pane layout). vhs alone gives you a clean pty to script, but it doesn't
know anything about tmux — so getting the real chrome on screen means
scripting a real `tmux` session from inside the recording. That's where
the risk lives: every `tmux` command without an explicit socket targets
whichever server is ambient, including the one the user (or you) are
currently attached to.

## The one rule that matters

**Every `tmux` invocation used for a recording must carry `-L
<isolated-socket-name>`, with no exceptions, including while debugging a
tape by hand.** `tmux -L <name>` creates a fully separate server and socket
file, independent of the `default` socket. Without it, `tmux new-session`,
`tmux kill-server`, or even innocuous-looking commands run against whatever
server the shell's `$TMUX` happens to point at — which, if you're iterating
inside an actual tmux session (very likely, since that's how most people
run a terminal), is the real one. A `kill-server` issued that way doesn't
just clean up the recording's throwaway session, it kills *every* real
session on the machine, including the one you're working in. This has
happened before during this kind of work; it is the reason this skill
exists.

Two concrete habits that follow from this:

- Pick one memorable socket name per project (e.g. `boomerang-demo-gif`)
  and use it for every `tmux` command in the tape, with no bare `tmux ...`
  calls anywhere.
- Also `unset TMUX` at the start of the tape's setup, before creating the
  isolated session. If the outer shell vhs launches happens to inherit a
  `$TMUX` from its own environment, some tmux subcommands will trust that
  over the explicit `-L` flag in surprising ways; clearing it removes the
  ambiguity entirely.

## Workflow

### 1. Decide what the recording needs to prove

Write down the one thing a viewer should walk away understanding (e.g.
"capturing an idea is fast enough that you don't lose your place in what
you were doing"). This drives two decisions below: whether the recording
needs real tmux chrome at all, and what should be visible on screen before
the interesting part starts. A recording that opens on a blank prompt and
then does the interesting thing reads as a feature demo; one that opens
mid-task and the interesting thing happens *as an interruption* reads as
"look how little this costs you" — pick deliberately, don't default to
blank-prompt-then-go.

### 2. Handle any real side effects the recording will cause

If the interaction under test does something real and externally visible
(creates a GitHub issue, sends a message, writes a file to a shared
location), decide up front whether to fake it or let it happen for real.
Letting it happen for real is usually more honest on screen (no fear of a
mocked UI looking subtly wrong), but don't let it land in a tracker or
system anyone actually uses for real work. If no safe target already
exists, create one: a dedicated, disposable resource that exists solely to
receive recording side effects (a private sandbox repo is the usual shape
for GitHub-issue-creating tools). Once it exists, point every future
recording at it and never worry about cleanup — that's the point of it
being disposable. Don't reuse a real project's tracker "just this once and
I'll close it after"; that habit doesn't scale to re-recordings after every
UI change.

### 3. Write the `.tape` file

Structure:

```
Output "path/to/output.gif"

Set Shell zsh
Set FontSize 14
Set Width <w>
Set Height <h>
Set Theme "<theme-name>"        # optional, see vhs's bundled theme list

Hide
Type "unset TMUX; tmux -L <isolated-socket> -f <tmux-config> new-session -s <name> <shell>"
Enter
Sleep 2s
# ... any other setup that shouldn't appear in the final recording ...
Show

# ... the actual scripted interaction, this part is what gets recorded ...

Hide
Type "exit"
Enter
```

Notes:

- `Hide` / `Show` let you execute real commands (setup, teardown) without
  them appearing in the rendered output, while still running in real time
  against the real pty. Use `Hide` liberally for anything that's plumbing
  rather than the demo itself — typing out a long setup command on screen
  both looks messy and burns the recording's time budget before the actual
  content appears.
- If the tmux config file path is needed after a `cd`, capture it as a
  shell variable *before* the `cd` (e.g. `REPO=$PWD` at the very start),
  then reference `$REPO/...`. A relative path typed after `cd`-ing
  elsewhere silently resolves against the wrong directory — this is an
  easy mistake to make and easy to miss because the tape doesn't error, it
  just doesn't show what you expect.
- Keep the isolated session's tmux config (keybinds etc.) as its own
  checked-in file alongside the tape, mirroring whatever the tool's real
  keybind looks like in a user's actual dotfiles, so the recording
  exercises the real chrome rather than a simplified stand-in.

### 4. Watch for terminal-theme conflicts

`Set Theme` remaps vhs's 16 base ANSI colors. It has no effect on anything
that emits truecolor (24-bit RGB) escape codes directly — most themed
shell prompts (Starship, Oh My Posh, etc.) do exactly that, so a themed
prompt will visibly fight whatever theme the tape requests. If the
recorded pane's prompt looks like it's not respecting `Set Theme`, this is
almost always why. Fix it by launching the pane's shell without loading
its normal rc files — `zsh -f` for zsh, `bash --norc --noprofile` for
bash — so no prompt tool initializes at all. This also has the side
benefit of a clean, fast-starting shell with no personal aliases or
functions that could shadow something the tape depends on.

### 5. Isolate the app's own config too, not just the terminal

If the tool being recorded reads its own persistent config (settings file,
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, dotfile), point that at a scratch location the same way
you isolate tmux — otherwise the recording's behavior depends on whatever
happens to be in the operator's real config that day, and a setting nobody
remembers is on (an "auto-exit after this action" toggle, a saved filter,
a theme) can silently change what the tape produces or cut it short in a
way that isn't obvious from reading the tape itself. `export
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$(mktemp -d)` before launching the app is usually enough
to get its defaults.

Watch for other tools sharing that same environment variable, though —
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in particular is also where things like `gh` or other
CLIs the tape shells out to keep their own config, including auth. Blindly
redirecting it strips their credentials along with the app's settings, so
if the tape needs one of those tools to actually work, symlink its real
config into the scratch directory first (e.g.
`ln -s ~/.config/gh/*.yml $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gh/`).

### 6. `clear` the screen before a fullscreen TUI launches

If the tool being recorded takes over the whole terminal (an alternate
screen buffer, same mechanism vim/tmux/less use) and the recording shows
the shell both before *and after* it runs, put a `clear` immediately
before launching it — even inside a `Hide` block. When a fullscreen program
exits, the terminal restores whatever the primary screen buffer looked
like before it launched, including anything typed during hidden setup:
`Hide` only skips *rendering* those frames, it doesn't erase them from the
pty's actual scrollback. Without the `clear`, the moment the program quits,
the whole hidden setup command reappears on screen as if it had been
visible all along.

This doesn't come up when the recording nests an isolated tmux session per
the sections above, since tmux's own alt-screen swallows the setup and the
recording never returns to the outer shell to reveal it — it's specifically
a concern for tools recorded directly in the outer pty.

### 7. Run it and inspect the result

```sh
vhs path/to/file.tape
```

Every time a tape renders a new or updated GIF, open it with `qlmanage -p
<path>` (Quick Look) so it pops up on screen for the user to actually watch
— do this unprompted, right after the render, not only when asked. macOS
Preview.app only shows a static first frame, so it doesn't substitute for
this. Launch it as a background process (e.g. `qlmanage -p <path> &`) so it
doesn't block the rest of the workflow (frame extraction, teardown
verification) behind the preview window being closed.

To inspect specific moments frame-by-frame yourself (useful for diagnosing
timing issues), extract frames with ffmpeg:

```sh
ffmpeg -i output.gif -vf "fps=4" frame-%03d.png
```

then read the relevant PNGs directly.

### 8. Verify the isolated session actually tore down

Don't assume the tape's teardown worked just because vhs exited cleanly.
If a scripted "exit" step doesn't land as expected — `Ctrl+D` failing to
register as EOF inside a REPL is a real failure mode, not a hypothetical
one — the isolated tmux server keeps running after vhs's own process
exits. That's harmless in isolation, but it silently breaks the *next*
recording: `tmux new-session -s <name>` collides with the leftover session
(`duplicate session: <name>`), the tape's subsequent keystrokes fall
through to whatever that stale session happens to be running instead of
the fresh one the tape assumes, and the result is a broken take that looks
like garbled input rather than an obvious error.

After every run:

```sh
tmux -L <isolated-socket> ls
```

should fail with "no server running" (or similar). If a server is still
there, `tmux -L <isolated-socket> kill-server` is always safe to run — it's
scoped to that one socket and cannot touch the default server or any real
session, no matter what's running elsewhere on the machine. Prefer an
explicit, unambiguous exit sequence in the tape's teardown (e.g. exiting an
inner REPL with its own explicit exit call, then exiting the outer shell)
over relying on a single `Ctrl+D` to cascade through multiple nested
programs.

## Worked examples

boomerang's `docs/demo/` has three complete, checked-in reference tapes,
plus `docs/demo/seed-issues.sh`, an idempotent script that resets their
shared sandbox repo to a known-good state before every recording (dedupes
issues left over from prior runs, resets the ones later tapes edit live
back to a pristine state, ensures any labels/filler data those tapes
expect actually exist) — the same pattern is worth copying whenever a
recording depends on specific external state existing. Read them for
concrete examples rather than starting from a blank tape:

- `quick-capture.tape` — the full nested-tmux pattern: isolated server,
  real `display-popup` chrome, Gruvbox theming with `zsh -f`, explicit
  multi-step teardown.
- `browse-and-yank.tape` and `edit-issue.tape` — the simpler direct
  pattern for a tool that doesn't need tmux chrome on screen at all: no
  nested server, but still `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` isolation (with `gh` auth
  preserved) and the pre-launch `clear` fullscreen TUIs need.

```sh
docs/demo/seed-issues.sh
vhs docs/demo/quick-capture.tape
vhs docs/demo/browse-and-yank.tape
vhs docs/demo/edit-issue.tape
```

Run from the repo root (prerequisites are documented in each tape's own
header comment).

## Checklist recap

- [ ] Every `tmux` command carries `-L <isolated-socket>`; `$TMUX` is
      unset before the isolated session is created. (Only applies if the
      recording nests tmux at all — skip for tools recorded directly.)
- [ ] Any real side effect lands in a disposable sandbox, never a real
      tracker or shared system.
- [ ] Setup/teardown plumbing is wrapped in `Hide`/`Show` so only the
      actual demo renders.
- [ ] The pane's shell skips rc files (`zsh -f` / `bash --norc`) if a
      themed prompt would otherwise fight `Set Theme`.
- [ ] The app's own config is isolated too (e.g. scratch
      `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), with any tool it shells out to still able to
      authenticate.
- [ ] A fullscreen (alt-screen) app recorded outside of tmux gets a
      `clear` right before it launches, if the recording returns to the
      outer shell afterward.
- [ ] After running, `tmux -L <isolated-socket> ls` reports no server —
      teardown actually happened, not just "vhs exited." (If tmux was
      nested at all.)
- [ ] Every rendered/re-rendered GIF is opened with `qlmanage -p <path> &`
      so the user sees it play, unprompted.
